# Sandbox Architecture

Navigator's sandboxing isolates a user command in a child process while policy parsing and
platform-specific enforcement live behind clear interfaces. The `navigator-sandbox` binary is the
entry point and spawns a child process, applying restrictions before `exec`.

## Components

- `crates/navigator-sandbox`: CLI + library that loads policy, spawns the child process, and applies sandbox rules.
- `crates/navigator-core`: shared types and utilities (policy schema, errors, config).
- `crates/navigator-server`: Server that stores sandbox policies and serves them via gRPC.

## Policy Model

Sandboxing is driven by a required policy configuration. There are two ways to provide it:

1. **gRPC mode** (production): Set `NAVIGATOR_SANDBOX_ID` and `NAVIGATOR_ENDPOINT` environment
   variables. The sandbox will fetch its policy from the Navigator server at startup via the
   `GetSandboxPolicy` RPC.

2. **File mode** (local development): Provide rego rules + YAML data files via
   `--policy-rules` + `--policy-data` (or `NAVIGATOR_POLICY_RULES` / `NAVIGATOR_POLICY_DATA`
   env vars).

The policy schema (defined in `dev-sandbox-policy.yaml`) includes:

- `filesystem_policy`: read-only and read-write allow lists, plus optional inclusion of the workdir. Any directories under `read_write` will automatically be created if they do not exist.
- `landlock`: compatibility behavior (`best_effort` or `hard_requirement`).
- `process`: optional `run_as_user`/`run_as_group` to drop privileges for the child process.
- `inference`: allowed routing hints for inference access control.
- `network_policies`: per-binary network access rules with endpoint and binary identity matching.

See `dev-sandbox-policy.yaml` for the full example.

## Dynamic Policy Loading (gRPC Mode)

When running in Kubernetes, the sandbox fetches its policy dynamically from the Navigator server
via gRPC instead of reading from a local file. This is the preferred mode for production deployments.

### Environment Variables

The pod template automatically injects these environment variables:

- `NAVIGATOR_SANDBOX_ID`: The sandbox entity ID in Navigator's store
- `NAVIGATOR_ENDPOINT`: gRPC endpoint for the Navigator server (e.g., `http://navigator:8080`)
- `NAVIGATOR_SANDBOX_COMMAND`: The command to execute inside the sandbox (user-provided, defaults to `/bin/bash` if not set)

### Startup Flow

1. Pod starts with `navigator-sandbox` entrypoint
2. Sandbox binary reads `NAVIGATOR_SANDBOX_ID` and `NAVIGATOR_ENDPOINT` from environment
3. Calls `GetSandboxPolicy(sandbox_id)` gRPC to fetch policy from Navigator server
4. Applies sandbox restrictions (Landlock, seccomp, privilege drop)
5. Executes the command from `NAVIGATOR_SANDBOX_COMMAND`, CLI args, or `/bin/bash` by default

### Policy Storage

The sandbox policy is stored as part of the `SandboxSpec` protobuf message in Navigator's persistence
layer. The policy is required when creating a sandbox via the `CreateSandbox` gRPC call. The policy
definition lives in `proto/sandbox.proto`.

## Linux Enforcement (Landlock + Seccomp)

Linux enforcement lives in `crates/navigator-sandbox/src/sandbox/linux`.

- Landlock restricts filesystem access to the allow lists from the policy. If no paths are listed,
  Landlock is skipped. When enabled, a ruleset is created and enforced before the child `exec`.
- Seccomp blocks socket creation for common network domains (IPv4/IPv6 and others), preventing the
  child process from opening outbound sockets directly.

## Proxy Routing

When `network.mode: proxy` is set, network traffic is forced through an HTTP CONNECT proxy that
enforces the `allow_hosts` allowlist. The proxy implementation lives in
`crates/navigator-sandbox/src/proxy.rs`.

### Network Namespace Isolation (Linux)

Seccomp alone cannot fully enforce proxy-only networking because it cannot filter `connect()` calls
by destination address (the sockaddr struct is a userspace pointer that seccomp cannot dereference).
A process that ignores `HTTP_PROXY` environment variables could connect directly to any IP.

To close this gap, proxy mode uses Linux network namespaces to isolate the sandboxed process:

```
HOST NAMESPACE                          SANDBOX NAMESPACE
──────────────                          ─────────────────
veth-host                               veth-sandbox
10.200.0.1/24  ◄─────────────────────►  10.200.0.2/24
     │                                       │
     ▼                                       ▼
Proxy (10.200.0.1:3128)                Sandboxed process
     │                                  (can ONLY reach 10.200.0.1)
     ▼
Internet (via allow_hosts)
```

**Setup sequence:**

1. Create a new network namespace (`ip netns add sandbox-{id}`)
2. Create a veth pair connecting host and sandbox namespaces
3. Assign IPs: host side gets `10.200.0.1/24`, sandbox side gets `10.200.0.2/24`
4. Configure default route in sandbox to go via `10.200.0.1`
5. Proxy binds to `10.200.0.1:3128` instead of localhost
6. Child process enters the namespace via `setns()` before `exec`

The implementation lives in `crates/navigator-sandbox/src/sandbox/linux/netns.rs`.

**Requirements:**

- `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`: Required for creating namespaces and mount operations
- `CAP_NET_ADMIN`: Required for creating veth pairs and configuring interfaces
- `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`: Required for the CONNECT proxy to read `/proc/<pid>/fd/` and
  `/proc/<pid>/exe` of sandbox-user processes. The proxy resolves binary identity by mapping
  TCP socket inodes (from `/proc/<entrypoint>/net/tcp{,6}`) to process file descriptors,
  then reading the executable symlink. Without this capability, the kernel blocks access to
  `/proc/<pid>/fd/` for processes running as a different user (the proxy runs as root,
  sandboxed processes run as the `sandbox` user).
- `iproute2` package: Provides the `ip` command for namespace/interface setup

If namespace creation fails (e.g., missing capabilities), the sandbox logs a warning and continues
without network isolation. This allows development/testing without elevated privileges, though
production deployments should ensure capabilities are granted.

### Proxy Environment Variables

The sandbox exports proxy configuration to the child process:

- `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY`: Uppercase variants for curl, wget, and similar tools
- `http_proxy` / `https_proxy` / `grpc_proxy`: Lowercase variants for gRPC C-core (libgrpc),
  which checks lowercase first

All set to `http://10.200.0.1:3128` (with netns) or `http://127.0.0.1:3128` (without netns).

## Process Privileges

The sandbox supervisor can run as a more privileged user while the child process drops to a less
privileged account before `exec`. Configure this via `process.run_as_user` and
`process.run_as_group` in the policy. If unset, the child inherits the supervisor's user/group.

## Zombie Reaping (PID 1 Init Duties)

`navigator-sandbox` runs as PID 1 inside the container. In Linux, when a process exits, its
parent must call `waitpid()` to collect the exit status; otherwise the process remains as a zombie.
Orphaned processes (whose parent exits first) are reparented to PID 1, which becomes responsible
for reaping them.

Coding agents running inside the sandbox (OpenClaw, Claude, Codex) frequently spawn background
daemons and child processes. When these grandchildren are orphaned, they become PID 1's
responsibility. Without reaping, they accumulate as zombies for the lifetime of the container.

The sandbox supervisor registers a `SIGCHLD` handler at startup and runs a background reaper task.
On each signal, it first inspects exited children with `waitid(..., WNOWAIT)` and checks whether
the PID belongs to a managed child with an explicit waiter (entrypoint or SSH session child). If
the PID is managed, it leaves the status for that waiter. Otherwise, it reaps the orphaned child.
This avoids `ECHILD` races with explicit `child.wait()` calls while still collecting orphan zombies.

## Platform Extensibility

Platform-specific implementations are wired through `crates/navigator-sandbox/src/sandbox/mod.rs`.
Non-Linux platforms currently log a warning and skip enforcement, leaving room for a macOS backend
later without changing the public policy or CLI surface.
